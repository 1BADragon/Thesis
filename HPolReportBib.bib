	abstract	= 	{Achieving a security goal in a networked system requires the cooperation of a variety of devices, each device potentially requiring a different configuration. Many information security problems may be solved with appropriate models of these devices and their interactions, giving a systematic way to handle the complexity of real situations. We present an approach, rigorous automated network security management, that front-loads formal modeling and analysis before problem solving, thereby providing easy-to-run tools with rigorously justified results. With this approach, we model the network and a class of practically important security goals. The models derived suggest algorithms that, given system configuration information, determine the security goals satisfied by the system. The modeling provides rigorous justification for the algorithms, which may then be implemented as ordinary computer programs requiring no formal methods training to operate. We have applied this approach to several problems. In this paper we describe two: distributed packet filtering and the use of IP security (IPsec) gateways. We also describe how to piece together the two separate solutions to these problems, jointly enforcing packet filtering as well as IPsec authentication and confidentiality on a single network.}

A formalization of the access control mechanism of the SELinux security server, together with a labeled transition system representing an SELinux con guration, provides our framework. Information ow security goal statements expressed in linear temporal logic provide a clear description of the objectives that SELinux is intended to achieve. We use model checking to determine whether security goals hold in a given system. These formal models combined with appropriate algorithms have led to automated tools for the veri cation of security properties in an SELinux system. Our approach has been used in other security management contexts over the past decade, under the name rigorous automated security management.}
